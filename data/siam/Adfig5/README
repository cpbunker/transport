Trying to replicate SIAM conductance dependence on gate voltage in 32-site chain,
as originally found in Feiguin et al, PRB (2006)
For half filled system, se whould see G/G0 saturate to 1 for Vg=0.0. At other
Vg values, G/G0 should drop off symmetrically with |Vg|
My results:
-I observse |Vg| symmetry and drop-off for th=0.4
-Results are very snesitive to th. For th=1.0 G/G0 converges to 1 for ALL Vg
 values, ie there is symmetry but no dropoff

**Results are current as of Apr 2025**
